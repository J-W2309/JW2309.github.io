<h2> Phyiscal Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Physical </h4>

<h2> Technical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Passwords </h4>
<p2> One of the first things you will do when settings up a SmartPhone is choosing your Password/Pin. Most newer SmartPhones now use finger prints or facial recognition for this instead which is much more secure however it is still important to make sure that whatever Password or Pin you choose is secure as it is a solid second line of defense against anyone trying to access your device.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Updates </h4>
Modern Smart Phones are the equivelent of having a small computer in your pocket. And just like computers they need to be kept up to date with not only new features but also protection. There are always going to be new ways for devices such as Phones to be Hacked into or threatened in some way. Making sure your mobile is updates is extremely important as these updates contain protection for your device against the newest threats. No matter what Smart Phone you have this is universal whether Apple, Android, Google etc, these devics need the constant maintenance. Due to updates being mostly optional many forget to manually set them of. To keep your device secure keep and eye on when it needs updating and make sure to do it when most convenient.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Wi-Fi </h4>
When it comes to Smart Devices Wi-Fi is one of the most important aspects. it is also one that needs to have a close eye kept on.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Apps </h4>    
It goes without saying that you should be careful what Apps you are downloading onto your Mobile Device. The majority of Apps are most likely safe and the App stores do monitor what is on there available however due to the sheer volume of apps its not always possible to notice malicious apps on first sight. Whenever downloading an App on your Smart Phone make sure that... One: it is a trusted manufacturer and within the App store. Two: That it isnt a decoy, some apps may take the apperance of another to trick the user into downloading. make sure you double check the Apps you are downloading to avoid this.  
<br>
<br>
<h4> Hacking </h4>   
 We are all aware of Hackers and Smart Phones are a major target. Due to their high value and the amount of information they store. There are a lot of different attacks hackers may try to pull. too many to outline here but most advice boils down to the simple stuff. Dont click and links that look suspicious, be careful who you give your information to, dont share any log in details etc. This guide will not go over every attack that could occour however there are many external tests that have been conducted and published on these devices. If you would like to read more visit the "published tests" section below.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Browsers </h4>   
 Browsers can vary depending on the device you use, however most are available to download on any. Some people prefer to use alternative Browsers that they are comfortable with. this is fine as long as you trust them and they are reputable. The main risk with Browsers is the information they store. Browsers themselves similar to the device will store a lot of your personal information for later use. as an example Google Chrome may store your passwords within the browser for ease of use. This is a very nifty feature however not always safe. The general rule of thumb is to be careful what you give your browser permission to see or use as well as pick a browser that is well known or that you know is secure.
