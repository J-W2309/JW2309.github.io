<h1> Smart Keychains </h1>
<br>    
<p> Smart Keychains are one of the smart devices designed to be very secure, not to say the others arent however the purpose of a smart keychain is to keep other possesions safe. These devices act like a normal keychain with added features. such as a lock, and the ability to connect to your other smart devices, you can also add things like passwords to your keychain to make it even more secure.

<h2> Phyiscal Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Physical </h4>
<p1> When it comes to a smart keychain physically they are quite vulnerable. They are very good at keeping your possesions on them safe however the device itself isnt the most secure, as a small device made to contain other important possesions you need to keep it in sight at all times. even though the possesions may stay safe it is a device that can be easily stolen and if a theif really wanted to they could break through. A lot of Smart keychains come with locks to protect the possesions and they also have tracking. This is a major upgrade from your traditional keychain as you can use your mobile phone or app to keep track of where your keychain is at all times. and in the event of it being stolen you can find out where it is.

<h2> Technical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<p2>
<h4> Hacking </h4>
Hacking can happen to any smart device due to their nature. Smart Keychains may not be the largest target for this however it is definietly possible. We recommend you keep your device and app up to date with he latest features to try and avoid trouble. This guide will not go over every attack that could occour however there are many external tests that have been conducted and published on these devices. If you would like to read more visit the "published tests" section below.

<br>
<h4> Wi-Fi </h4>
When it comes to Smart Devices Wi-Fi is one of the most important aspects. it is also one that needs to have a close eye kept on.
