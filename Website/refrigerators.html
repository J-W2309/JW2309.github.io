<h1> Refrigerators </h1>
<br>    
<p> Smart Refrigerators have become quite a sought after applicance in recent years. They arent all that different from your standard refrigerator other than the fact you can control your home and connect to other devices through it while keeping the basic functions the same. Smart Refrigerators may seem like one of the safer smart devices in your home, its in one place, cant be stolen etc. However, there are still some risks involved in owning one.

Compared to the majority of smart devices this one is usually a large object and installed within a household. There is slim to none chances of theft in that aspect. however one issue could occour that an intruder may be able to gain access to the rest of your Smart home using this device. due to this even a Smart Refrigerator needs a password to protect it.
