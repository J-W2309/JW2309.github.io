<h1> Smart Watches </h1>
<br>    
<p> Smart Watches are a newer digital version of your traditional wrist watch. They have similar characteristics to Mobile Phones. in that they can access the internet, apps, smart watches can even be used in place of a mobile phone to operate your other smart devices. Due to this Smart Watches have become very popular contaning all the features of a traditional watch mixed with a smart phone. however with this comes some security risks both technical and physical which will be outlined below.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Phyiscal Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Physical</h4>
<p1> Watches similar to other handheld Smart Devices are quite vulnerable physically. The ability to lose them or misplace is a risk involved in owning these devices however unlike your traditional wrist watch losing a smart watch could be a much bigger issue. due to the amount of information stores on these devices you are not only losing a watch, you are losing your data too. The same prinicpals of a mobile phone apply to the smart watch also. keep it on or near you at all times especially in public. As it is a smaller item it can be easy to misplace but as long as you stay attentive keeping your smart watch physically safe shouldnt be an issue.

<br>    
<h2> Technical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<p2>
<h4> Data </h4>
Smart Watches hold a lot of information. Due to their nature they are almost comparable to mobile phones in the amount of personal information stored. This is highly convenient to have all of this on your wrist however it opens you up to security risks you wouldnt get with a traditional watch. The same general rules apply for data on all smart devices. Be careful who you share your information with. what apps you may allow access, which browsers etc. Keeping your data secure should be a number one priority.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Hacking </h4>
Smart watches are vulnerable to Hacking. Smart watches use similar technlogoy to other smart devices that are going to be vulnerable to hacking. this is one of the downsides of switching to Smart technology. To prevent this try to keep your information private, passwords secure and always keep your device up to date with the latest security. This guide will not go over every attack that could occour however there are many external tests that have been conducted and published on these devices. If you would like to read more visit the "published tests" section below.    
<br>
<br>
<h4> Settings </h4>
Smart watches have their own settings however, they appropriate security settings may not be set up straight away. like many Smart Devices the settings need to be configured and set up to protect your device. enabling things like two factor authentication can add a much stronger layer of defense for your device. when you get a new Smart Watch make sure to check through your settings and make sure it is set up properly and up to date. 
<br>
<br>
<h4> Wi-Fi </h4>
When it comes to Smart Devices Wi-Fi is one of the most important aspects. it is also one that needs to have a close eye kept on.    
<br>
<br>
<h4> Tracking </h4>
The majority of Smart Watches have tracking features. This cna be used to track you as a person or the watch if it gets lost. this is a feature that has upsides and downsides concerning security. On the upside if your device is lost but has tracking enabled it can be easy to find. however some people may not feel secure having their movements tracked by their device. there is ususally settings on your device to turn this on or off depending on your stance.
