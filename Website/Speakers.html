<h1> Speakers </h1>
<br>    
<p> Smart Speakers are becoming increasingly popular among many households, even those who arent as interested in having a smart home may still own one of these devices. They work in the same way as other mobile smart devices in that you plug it in and connect to your home. They are mostly designed around playing music however there are many other uses such as their voice recognition features. they can be used to google, play music, read you a book etc. There are a lot of different speakers on the market however they mostly do the same things. Like any smart device though, there are some security risks involved.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Phyiscal Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Physical </h4>
<p1> A Smart Speaker, like other small smart devices are prone to damage. they may not be as small as your mobile phone or a smart watch however they are quite delicate and should be looked after. A difference here is that Smart Speakers usually are placed in the same place within a home. The majority require to be plugged in and there voice features can hear far meaning there isnt a requirement to move them. As the same with all smaller Smart devices put it somewhere secure, these devices are a prime target for theft therefore keeping it out of reach and or sight may be a good precaution.

<h2> Technical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<p2>
<h4> Passwords </h4>
Most Smart Speaker work a bit differently than other smart devices. while the majority use screens and active motion from the user a lot of smart speakers dont, they use your voice. This can be seen as an upside and a downside. on one hand they are fairly secure using voice recogniton however their isnt as much in the way of settings and things you can configureas a user. Most of the configurations are done using an app for the speaker so make sure you look through these and configure your settings appropriately.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Voice Recognition </h4>
Voice Recognation is a major function of a Smart Speaker. This feature is fairly secure however could potentially be manipulated. Depending on the speaker it may be configured to only respons to certain voices, this is pretty secure and has much less issues however, there are many speakers which dont do this, or people dont configure to. Now this may sound fine however there are scenarios where this is a major security risk, Imagine for second your smart home is hooked up with a Smart Lock and Speaker. there is potential for an intruder to access your speaker through voice controls and unlock your door. now this is a far fetched idea however it shows the dangers this could include. A speaker like your mobile phone is a gateway into the rest of your smart home and it is important that its kept secure.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Wi-Fi </h4>
When it comes to Smart Devices Wi-Fi is one of the most important aspects. it is also one that needs to have a close eye kept on.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Updates </h4>
Updates are a key part of keeping your Smart home secure and speakers are no different. They may not need constant hardware upgrades like a phone but they and their apps do need to be kept up to date in order to maintain security. There are always new threats surfacing everyday for smart devices and keeping updated with the developers software is important to stop this.
